## Description

This project aims to develop a lightweight and robust distributed application for executing and controlling the execution of processes across a set of machines. It will be implemented in both Rust and C. Comparisons between the languages will be made to best meet the requirements. We will refer to this application as a "Control Daemon". The application will use a daemon-based architecture, with a long-running process on each machine, providing a remote control interface.
